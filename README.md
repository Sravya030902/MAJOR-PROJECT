# MAJOR-PROJECT
"DETECTION OF PHISHING WEBSITES USING MACHINE LEARNING"

#OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:

The aim of the phishers is to acquire critical information like username, password and bank account details. Cyber security persons are now looking for trustworthy and steady detection techniques for phishing websites detection. This proposed model deals with machine learning technology for detection of phishing URLs by extracting and analyzing various features of legitimate and phishing URLs. The SVM (support vector machine), Lightgbm (Light Gradient Boosting Method) machine learning algorithms are used to detect phishing websites. The main objective of this project is to detect any URL into phishing URL or the legitimate URL. We are mainly using the supervised machine learning techniques out of which classification algorithms are used to classify the URLs to be genuine or fake, finally we are going to narrow down to best machine learning algorithm by comparing accuracy rate, false positive and false negative rate of each algorithm.

#SCOPE AND CHALLENGES:

~SCOPE

The scope of the proposed model can be in the following ways:

•	The prototype detects the fake or phishing websites who are trying to get access to the sensitive data or by creating the fake websites and trying to get access of the user personal credentials

•	This system can be used by many E-commerce or other websites in order to have good customer relationship. 

•	User can make online payment securely. 

•	Data mining algorithm used in this system provides better performance as compared to other traditional classifications algorithms.

•	With the help of this system user can also purchase products online without any hesitation.

~CHALLENGES

The challenges faced during the project are as follows:

• Finding the appropriate dataset.

• Feature extraction required the study of various modules and understanding each
  Module and getting the expected outcome from it.
